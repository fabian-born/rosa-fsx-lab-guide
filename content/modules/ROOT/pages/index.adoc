= ROSA FSx Workshop
:numbered:

This lab guide provides a walkthrough on using FSx for ONTAP as a persistent storage layer for applications on *Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS* (ROSA). It will guide you through the steps to install the NetApp Trident Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver on a ROSA cluster. Additionally, you will learn how to provision an FSx for ONTAP file system, deploy a sample stateful application. To ensure your dataâ€™s resilience, you learn how to backup and restore your application data.

NOTE: This lab guide assumes you are using the RHDP environment and are logged into the bastion.

== Lab Setup

=== Authenticate `oc` to the cluster

The bastion provided with the RHDP workshop has the `aws` and `rosa` command line tools already installed and logged in.  The `oc` command is installed, but not authenticated.

To authenticate `oc` use the API URL, username, and password provided by the RHDP lab deployment.

[source,bash,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
oc login {rosa_openshift_api_url} -u {rosa_openshift_admin_user} -p {rosa_openshift_admin_password}
----

=== Git clone the lab repo

Clone the Git repository:

[source,bash,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
git clone {git_repo} rosa-fsx
----

`cd` into the rosa-fsx/fsx directory. This will be the main working directory for the lab.

[source,bash,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
cd ~/rosa-fsx/fsx
----
